# Get Next Line

## **Description**
The **Get Next Line** project is a practical C programming exercise focused on creating a function that reads a line from a file descriptor, one line at a time. This function is essential for processing input from files or standard input in an organized way. By working on this project, you will explore concepts like static variables, memory management, and buffer handling, which are critical for efficient and clean code.

## **What I Learned**
1. **Static Variables**:
   - Gained a deeper understanding of static variables and their ability to retain values between function calls.
   - Learned how to use static variables to manage persistent states, such as tracking progress in a file.

2. **Memory Management**:
   - Practiced allocating and freeing dynamic memory with `malloc` and `free`.
   - Used tools like `valgrind` to detect and prevent memory leaks.

3. **File Descriptors**:
   - Improved knowledge of file descriptors and their role in interacting with files.
   - Understood the importance of efficient reading and buffer management to handle different file sizes.

4. **Norminette and Coding Standards**:
   - Enhanced my ability to write clean and structured code that complies with Norminette rules.

5. **Testing and Debugging**:
   - Developed strategies for testing edge cases, including large files, small buffers, and files without newline characters.
   - Learned the importance of testing with tools like `gdb` and `valgrind` for debugging and memory analysis.

6. **Bonus Features**:
   - Explored advanced features like handling multiple file descriptors simultaneously.
   - Understood how to use a single static variable effectively for additional functionality.

This project has not only strengthened my C programming skills but also prepared me to tackle more complex coding challenges in the future.
